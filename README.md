## Introduction

MiniWorld is a minimalistic 3D interior environment simulator for reinforcement
learning &amp; robotics research. It can be used to simulate environments with
rooms, doors, hallways and various objects (eg: office and home environments, mazes).
MiniWorld can be seen as a simpler alternative to VizDoom or DMLab. It is written
100% in Python and designed to be easily modified or extended by students.

Features:

- Few dependencies, less likely to break, easy to install
- Easy to create your own levels, or modify existing ones
- Good performance, high frame rate, support for multiple processes
- Lightweight, small download, low memory requirements
- Provided under a permissive MIT license
- Comes with a variety of free 3D models and textures
- Fully observable [top-down/overhead view](images/maze_top_view.jpg) available
- [Domain randomization](https://blog.openai.com/generalizing-from-simulation/) support, for sim-to-real transfer
- Ability to [display alphanumeric strings](images/textframe.jpg) on walls
- Ability to produce depth maps matching camera images (RGB-D)

Limitations:

- Graphics are basic, nowhere near photorealism
- Physics are very basic, not sufficient for robot arms or manipulation

This simulator was created as part of work done at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/).

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- Gymnasium
- NumPy
- Pyglet (OpenGL 3D graphics)
- GPU for 3D graphics acceleration (optional)

You can install it from `PyPI` using:

```console
python3 -m pip install miniworld
```

You can also install from source:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Miniworld.git
cd Miniworld
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

If you run into any problems, please take a look at the [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Usage

There is a simple UI application which allows you to control the simulation or real robot manually.
The `manual_control.py` application will launch the Gym environment, display camera images and send actions
(keyboard commands) back to the simulator or robot. The `--env-name` argument specifies which environment to load.
See the list of [available environments](docs/environments.md) for more information.

```
./manual_control.py --env-name MiniWorld-Hallway-v0

# Display an overhead view of the environment
./manual_control.py --env-name MiniWorld-Hallway-v0 --top_view
```

There is also a script to run automated tests (`run_tests.py`) and a script to gather performance metrics (`benchmark.py`).

### Offscreen Rendering (Clusters and Colab)

When running MiniWorld on a cluster or in a Colab environment, you need to render to an offscreen display. You can
run `gym-miniworld` offscreen by setting the environment variable `PYOPENGL_PLATFORM` to `egl` before running MiniWorld, e.g.

```
PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=egl python3 your_script.py
```

Alternatively, if this doesn't work, you can also try running MiniWorld with `xvfb`, e.g.

```
xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1024x768x24 -ac +extension GLX +render -noreset" python3 your_script.py
```
